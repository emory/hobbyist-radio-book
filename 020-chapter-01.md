### Chapter 1 - Personal Radio Communications

## Introduction

Electromagnetic radio waves are an invisible force that are continuously passing through us and the things around us. Radio waves are a recent discovery and when controlled, they make our modern life convenient.

Smart phones, such as iPhone or Android, include a number of built-in radios to allow them to connect to various services and become the can't-live-without-it devices that we use today. The radios inside today's smart phones include but are not limited to Wi-Fi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and Cellular.

Besides your phone, the other radios you and your family most likely use are the music blaring AM/FM radios in your car and home. Your car might connect to your phone via bluetooth. You might have a TV that has an antenna to pick up local television stations. Your garage door opener sends a radio signal to open or close the door. Contlactless payment terminals at your local convenience store use radio frequencies. Wireless charging devices operate at specific frequencies.

Laptops and tablet computers include Bluetooth radios that allow your wireless keyboard, mice and trackpads to connect. Wi-Fi is also an essential radio in most computers which allows you to connect to your home or business router to get online.

Many devices around us use these invisible radio frequencies. Without them, modern life with look much different than it does today. Throughout the course of this book, we'll be focused on two-way communications using radio frequencies that are free to listen on but some may require a license to transmit on. We'll discuss the differences and who uses each. Let's jump in!

## Definitions

In this book we'll use the terms below in our discussions around radio hardware and radio waves. You may want to bookmark this chapter and use it as a reference for these definitions.

* **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: The earliest method of encoding and transmitting messages via radio waves, where the signal strength varies depending on the message
* **Band**: A collection of related frequencies or channels
* **Bluetooth**: Short range wireless standard for computer networks
* **Call Sign**: An identifier, consisting of letters and numbers, which is assigned by the FCC and is used by radio operators to identify themselves
* **Channel**: A pre-programmed value that matches a frequency
* **Duplex**: Using multiple channels to transmit and receive
* **Emission**: Any radio signal from a transmitter
* **Frequency**: The number of invisible electromagnetic waves that pass a fixed point in time, measured in hertz
* **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: An alternative to AM encoding, where the signal strength remains constant but the frequency is shifted
* **Full Duplex**: Simultaneously transmitting and receiving signals (cell phones have this feature)* **High Frequency (HF)**:
* **Half Duplex**: Pushing a PTT button or a VOX feature is required to transmit
* **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: A system of satellites and signals that is used to determined a device's position on the Earth
* **Handheld Transceiver (HT)**: A hand-held two-way radio
* **Mobile Radio**: A radio that requires an external power source and can be mounted in a vehicle
* **Near-field comminication (NFC)**: A low-power, wireless technology that is commonly used for contactless payment systems
* **Push to Talk (PTT)**: A button on a radio that, when pushed, stops receiving and begins transmitting
* **Radio**: An electronic device which receives and/or transmits electromagnetic signals and converts those signals to an audio or video format
* **Receive**: Accepting and processing a signal
* **Repeater**: A device that retransmits signals to extend the range of the original transmission
* **Rubber Duck**: The standard antenna included on a handheld
* **Simplex**: Using a single channel to transmit and receive
* **Side Bands (SB)**: An AM signal that is transmitted on both sides of a given frequency
* **Single Side Band (SSB)**: An AM signal that transmits on either the lower or upper band of a frequency (left to right)
* **Spectrum**: A range of frequencies
* **Squelch**: A radio function which mutes the speaker when no signal is detected
* **Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)**: A measurement of how well an antenna is matched to its transmission radio frequency voltage
* **Transceiver**: A radio that can both receive and transmit on one or more frequencies
* **Transmit**: Processing and then sending a radio signal
* **Ultra High Frequency (UHF)**: Frequencies between 300 megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz)
* **Very High Frequency (VHF)**: Frequencies between 30 through 300 megahertz (MHz)
* **Voice Activated Transmit (VOX)**: A voice-activated feature on half duplex radios which makes the device hands-free
* **Wi-Fi**: Short range wireless standard for computer networks

## Radio Bands

The radio frequency ranges or bands are well defined by governments. In the United States, these bands are defined in table 1-1 below.

_**Table 1-1**_ Radio Bands with Examples

| Abbreviation | Band Name | Range | Example Usage | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VLF | Very Low Frequency | 3 kHz - 30 kHz | Military, HAM | Longest range | Slow data transmission speeds |
| LF | Low Frequency | 30 kHz - 300 kHz | Time signals, military, RFID tags (e.g. HOV lanes, animal identification), HAM | Long range | Slow data transmission speeds |
| MF | Medium Frequency | 300 kHz - 3 MHz | AM radio, HAM, radio controlled drones/models | Long range | More susceptible to interference for AM audio broadcasts vs FM audio broadcasts |
| HF | High Frequency | 3 MHz - 30 MHz | Military, aviation, HAM, CB, radio controlled toys, NFC | Mid range |
| VHF | Very High Frequency | 30 MHz - 300 MHz | HAM, MURS, FM radio, radio-controlled toys, some TV channels | Mid range | Mid range allows for a wide range of devices to work in an area without causing interference |
| UHF | Ultra High Frequency | 300 MHz - 3GHz | Some TV channels, government, FRS, GMRS, cellular phones, Wi-Fi, HAM, garage door openers, car key fobs, Bluetooth | High data transmission speeds | Short range |
| SHF | Super High Frequency | 3GHz - 30 GHz | Microwave ovens, radar, Wi-Fi | High data transmission speeds | Short range |
| EHF | Extremely High Frequency | 30 GHz - 300 GHz | Astronomy, 5G cell phones, military, airport body scanners | Very high data transmission speeds | Shortest range |

## Regulations

The radio spectrum is managed by agencies assigned by most governments. In the United States (of which this guide will focus on), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is the agency which manages the radio spectrum. The FCC makes assignments for frequencies and can impose fines for violations.
