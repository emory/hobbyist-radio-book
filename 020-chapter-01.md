### Chapter 1 - Personal Radio Communications

## Introduction

Radio waves are an invisible force that is all around us and passing through each of us and the walls of your house. Without thinking about it, you most likely utilize these invisible waves in some form or another throughout your day.

Smart phones, such as the iPhone or an Android phone, include a number of built-in radios to allow them to connect to various services and become the can't-live-without-it devices that we use today. The radios inside today's smart phones include Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and Cellular.

Besides your phone, the other radios you and your family use most often are the music blaring FM radios in your car and home. You might also have a TV that has an antenna to pick up local television stations. Your garage door opener sends a signal on a radio frequency.

Laptops and tablet computers include Bluetooth radios that allow your wireless keyboard, mice and trackpads to connect. Wi-Fi is also an essential radio in most computers which allows you to connect to your home or business router to get online.

## Definitions

Throughout each chapter we'll define the terms that we'll then use to in our discussions around learning about and using the available radio types.

* **Radio**: An electronic device which receives and/or transmits electromagnetic signals and converts those signals to an audio or video format
* **Spectrum**: A range of frequencies
* **Radio Wave**:
* **Transceiver**: A radio that can both receive and transmit on one or more frequencies
* **Frequency**: 
* **Transmit**: Processing and then sending a signal
* **Receive**: Accepting and processing a signal
* **Signal**:
* **Frequency Modulation (FM)**:
* **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**:
* **Very High Frequency (VHF)**:
* **High Frequency (HF)**:
* **Ultra High Frequency (UHF)**: Frequencies between 300 megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz)
* **Channel**:
* **Simplex**: Using a single channel to transmit and receive
* **Duplex**: Using multiple channels to transmit and receive
* **Half Duplex**: Pushing a PTT button or a VOX feature is required to transmit
* **Full Duplex**: Simultaneously transmitting and receiving signals (cell phones have this feature)
* **Push to Talk (PTT)**: A button on a radio that, when pushed, stops receiving and begins transmitting
* **Wi-Fi**: Short range wireless standard for computer networks
* **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: A system of satellites and signals that is used to determined a device's position on the Earth
* **Bluetooth**: Short range wireless standard for computer networks
* **Voice Activated Transmit (VOX)**: A voice-activated feature on half duplex radios which makes the device hands-free

## Regulations

The radio spectrum is managed by agencies assigned by most governments. In the United States (of which this guide will focus on), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is the agency which manages the radio spectrum. The FCC makes assignments for frequencies and can impose fines for violations.
