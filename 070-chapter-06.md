### Chapter 6 - Amateur (ham) Radio

## Introduction

Amateur radio, also known as ham radio, consists of a set of frequencies which can be used by licensed radio operators. Ham operators are allowed to use a wide range of frequencies, some of which allow wide-area transmissions and in some cases as far as thousands of miles.

The FCC regulates radio transmissions and stations within the US borders. FRS, GMRS, MURS and CBRS radio frequencies are generally short range communications. Ham radio operators can use frequencies and use transmission powers that allow them to communicate across national borders. Because these transmissions can reach across borders, the Internal Amateur Radio Union, a group of national organizations which regulate and govern those frequencies.

In the US, the radio stations that FRS, GMRS, MURS and CBRS radio operators use must be authorized by the FCC. Ham radio stations are not under the same restrictions, which allows for more flexibility and tinkering by their owners.

## Definitions
## Frequencies

In previous chapters we've listed frequencies and their corresponding channels. Because ham radios can access a wide spectrum of frequencies, there isn't a regulated set of pre-defined channel to frequency mapping. Ham operators will tune to a specific frequency instead.

_**Table 6-1**_ HF Ham Frequencies

| Transmit/Receive Frequency (MHz) | Wavelength (meters) | License Class | Maximum Transmit Power (in watts) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.8 | 160 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 3.5 | 80 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 5.3 | 60 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 7 | 40 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 10.1 | 30 | General and Amateur Extra | 200 |
| 14 | 20 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 18 | 17 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 21 | 15 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 24 | 12 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |
| 28 | 10 | General and Amateur Extra | 1500 |

_**Table 6-2**_ VHF Ham Frequencies

| 219-220 | 1.25 | Technician and higher | 50 |
| 222-225 | 1.25 | Technician and higher | 1500 |

_**Table 6-3**_ UHF Ham Frequencies

| Transmit/Receive Frequency (MHz) | Wavelength (centimeters) | License Class | Maximum Transmit Power (in watts) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 420-450 | 70 | Technician and higher | 1500 |
| 902-928 | 33 | Technician and higher | 1500 |
| 1240-1300 | 23 | Technician and higher | 1500 |
| 2300-2310 | 13 | Technician and higher | 1500 |
| 2390-2450 | 13 | Technician and higher | 1500 |

_**Table 6-4**_ Wavelength/Frequency Conversion

| Formula | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ℷ=300/f | wavelength=300/frequency (MHz) |
| f=300/ℷ | frequency (MHz) = 300/wavelength |

## Antennas

Ham radio antennas can range from stock antennas included with handhelds to antennas that can be mounted on vehicles for mobile radios, to fixed base station antennas mounted on rooftops or on the ground. The type of antenna you need depends on a number of factors. Do you need to be mobile? Which frequencies are you monitoring? The answers to these questions will determine the specific type of antenna you'll need.

Ham radio antennas come in many sizes and types. Omnidirectional (radiating power in all directions), directional (radiating power in one direction), dummy (no or very little radiated power). Let's examine each in the table below.

_**Table 6-5**_ Handheld Antenna Types

| Type | Range | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Dummy | A few feet | Used to test radios without creating noise on a frequency |
| Rubber Duck | Several miles | The stock antenna that ships with most handheld radios |
| Roll-up J-pole | Several miles, longer range than a rubber duck | Longer range antenna that can be rolled up for storage and transport |

_**Table 6-6**_ Mobile Antenna Types

Mobile antennas can be mounted to a vehicle either temporarily with a magnet or permanently with a bracket.

| Type | Range | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| 1/4 Wave Vertical | 10s of miles | The shortest length and thus shortest range |
| 1/2 Wave Vertical | Farther than a 1/4 wave | Longer than a 1/4 wave antenna, with better range |
| 5/8 Wave Vertical | Farther than a 1/2 wave | The longest length and thus the longest range |

_**Table 6-7**_ Base Station  Antenna Types

Base station antennas can be temporarily or permanently mounted on the ground, on a roof or some other semi-permanent or permanent location. Base stations typically transmit at higher wattages than hand helds and mobile stations. Combining higher wattages with larger antennas allows for farther transmission and reception than any other ham radio configuration.

| Type | Common Usage | Directional/Omnidirectional |
|---|---|---|
| J-pole | 2 meter band | Omnidirectional |
| Ground plane | 2 meter band | Omnidirectional |
| Yagi | Multiple bands | Directional |
| Dipole | 70 cm and 2 meter bands | Omnidirectional |

## Range

As we've learned, the range of ham radio communications varies widely depending on a number of factors, including but not limited to transmission power, antenna type, frequency and weather. While a handheld unit might have a range of several miles, a mobile unit could have a range of dozens of miles. A base station transmitting at 1500 watts with a SWR of 1:0 and a Yagi antenna (or another directional antenna) can bounce its electromagnetic waves off of the ionosphere over a distance of thousands of miles.

There are also a number of ways to communicate over long distances. EchoLink is one of these services which uses the Internet to allow stations to communicate anywhere the software is running anywhere in the world. Repeaters, which we'll discuss next, are also a common method used to greatly extend the range of ham radio transmissions.

## Repeaters
## Common Uses
## Common Practices

There are a number of common phrases that ham radio operators use to communicate. Some of these phrases are carried over from CB radio operations.

_**Table 6-6**_ Common Shortcut Phrases

| Phrase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 73 | Best regards |
| CQ | An invitation to respond |
| Rig | A radio |

### Q Codes

Q codes are used as shorthand for communicating with others over the airwaves. They are common phrases that are encoded down to a three-letter phrase to save time when using voice communications.

Because of accents, similar-sounding letters and the requirement to announce call signs over the air, it's necessary to establish a common pronounciation for letters of the English alphabet. Table 6-6 defines the related words for each letter and their common pronounciations. The full words and pronounciations for each letter allow hams to clearly express their intent. For example, if a user's call sign was KG7TVE, the last three characters sound similar. It would be clear to both announce the call sign normally, and then spell it out, as in Kilo-Golf-Seven-Tango-Victor-Echo. Others who were listening to the transmission would have a much easier time interpreting the call sign with each letter pronounced as a separate word. Single digit numbers also have phonetic pronunciations to prevent ambiguity.

### Making Contact

There are a number of ways to establish contact with other ham operators. Making contact is commonly refered to as a QSO. When making contact, you should log information about the operators that you contacted, such as the date and their call sign. Here are a few ways to make contact.

#### Unused Frequency

Find an open frequency and listen for a little bit to make sure it is clear or that there aren't any active communications happening on this frequency.

```
You: Is this frequency in use? <Your call sign>
You: CQ CQ CQ <Your call sign> CQ CQ CQ <pause and wait for a response>
Them: <they could reply with both their and your call signs>
You: <your first name> your signal is <strong|weak>
Them: <their first name> your signal is <strong|weak>
They may may then want to carry on a conversation
```

#### Radio Check

```
You: <Call Sign> Radio Check. How do I sound?
Them: <Your call sign> I hear you loud and clear (or something similar). Your signal is <strong|weak>
You: Great. Thank you.
```

## Licensing

The FCC regulates the ham radio frequencies by requiring that operators show some proficiency by obtaining a license. There are three licenses available, each building on the previous license. We'll explain each below.

_**Table 6-8**_ Ham Licenses

| License | Description | Allowed Frequencies | Call Sign |
|---|---|---|---|
| Technician | The entry-level license | Above 30 MHz | Six digits assigned by the FCC |
| General | | | Six digits assigned by the FCC |
| Amateur Extra | | All frequency bands | First two digits are assigned by the FCC, the last three can be requested |

Once obtained, a license is good for 10 years. Each license requires an exam which can be taken online.
