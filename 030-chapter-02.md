### Chapter 2 - Family Radio Service

## Introduction

Family Radio Service (FRS) is an unrestricted set of frequencies or channels that are open for any non-commercial use.

## Definitions
## Channels and Frequencies

FRS radios are pre-programmed (and cannot be modified) with the frequencies in table 2-1 below. Each frequency maps to a channel to make it easier to use.

Why use channels? It's similar to how your over-the-air TV stations work - for most of us it's easier to remember set your TV to channel 2 (KUTV in Utah) rather than tuning your TV to a frequency in the 590 - 596 MHz range.

Some FRS radios will allow you to scroll through the frequencies rather than by channel, if you prefer.

The wattage for channels 1-7 and 15-22 is up to 2 watts. This allows for greater broadcasting distances. Channels 8-14 only allow for broadcasting up to 0.5 watts, so use the higher-wattage channels if for greater range if needed.
