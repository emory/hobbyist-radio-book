### Chapter 4 - Multi-Use Radio Service

## Introduction

Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) is a set of frequencies that are available for personal and business use. It differs from FRS and GMRS in that FRS and GMRS share frequencies between 462 and 467 MHz, whereas MURS uses a separate set of frequencies between 151 and 154 MHz. The lower the frequency, the further the distance the radio waves can travel under optimal conditions.

MURS radios are allowed to transmit on five frequencies. They are allowed to have replacement antennas. They are not allowed to use repeaters to extend their range.

Users of the MURS frequencies are not required to obtain a license. Because MURS radios are limited to only a handful of frequencies, they are generally easier to operate.
