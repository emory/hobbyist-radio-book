### Chapter 4 - Multi-Use Radio Service

## Introduction

Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) is a set of frequencies that are available for personal and business use. It differs from FRS and GMRS in that FRS and GMRS share frequencies between 462 and 467 MHz, whereas MURS uses a separate set of frequencies between 151 and 154 MHz. The lower the frequency, the further the distance the radio waves can travel under optimal conditions.

MURS radios are allowed to transmit on five frequencies. They are allowed to have replacement antennas. They are not allowed to use repeaters to extend their range.

Users of the MURS frequencies are not required to obtain a license. Because MURS radios are limited to only a handful of frequencies, they are generally easier to operate.

Just like FRS AND GMRS radios, MURS radios support CTCSS and DCS to ignore unwanted transmissions. Some MURS radios support changing the CTCSS and DCS tones on the radios, others require you to connect the radio to a computer to program the tones.

The MURS frequencies are available for personal and business use. Some big box warehouses and large retail store employees communicate via MURS radios.

## Channels and Frequencies

_**Table 4-1**_ MURS Channels and Frequencies

| Channel | Transmit/Receive Frequency (MHz) | Maximum Transmit Power (in watts) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 151.82 | 2 |
| 2 | 151.88 | 2 |
| 3 | 151.94 | 2 |
| 4 | 154.57 | 2 |
| 5 | 154.60 | 2 |

## Antennas

FCC approved MURS radios are allowed to have replaceable antennas. This means that you can add a whip antenna to slightly increase the transmission range, or add an antenna to the roof of your car or home to greatly increase your range.

## Range

As with FRS, the range varies greatly depending up on terrain and obstacles. If you can see the other person you're trying to communicate with (line of sight), the distance you can transmit and receive will be farther than when there are buildings, trees or other obstacles between you.

The maximum transmit wattage of 2 watts is also a limiting factor. It matches channels 1-7 and 15-22 in the FRS channel spectrum, so with the basic antenna on a MURS radio the range would most likely be similar to an FRS radio transmitting on one of those 2 watt channels.

## Common Uses

Just like FRS and GMRS, MURS channels can be used for either business or personal use. Personal use could include hiking, caravaning, boating, etc. MURS is great for business use within a somewhat close proximity such as a warehouse or small geographical area outside because the radios are easy to set up and use.

## Common Practices

GMRS users are licensed and required to state their call sign at regular intervals. FRS and GMRS radios share a number of frequencies, which means that FRS users on the same frequency might hear an occasional GMRS call sign. Because MURS radios don't require a license and don't share frequencies with FRS and GMRS, you won't hear call signs or other communications that are common on those frequencies.

A Roger Beep function can help signal when you have pressed and then released the push to talk button. Otherwise, it's up to the user how they start and end their radio transmissions.

## Wrap-up

MURS radios are license free, basic radios that operate on 5 channels. They are great for either personal or business use because of their simplicity. They don't share channels with FRS or GMRS, so everyone using a MURS radio within range is most likely there for the same purpose.

So far we've discussed radios and frequencies that are available to unlicensed users. Next, we'll discuss ham radios and frequencies, which require a license and some training.
