### Chapter 8 - Summary

Thank you for walking with me on a journey of Hobbyist Radio Communications. While on this journey we've discussed many ways that radios support our modern lives, including devices such as cell phones, contactless payments, garage door openers and others. We've discussed the available radio bands for users specifically in the United States. We've defined terminology to increase our vocabulary so that we can increase our knowledge and have higher-level conversations with other radio enthusiasts.

In regards to hobbyist radios, we started our discussion on FRS radios and how their simplicity and free radio bands drives their popularity. We used this as a foundation when we discussed GMRS and the additional capabilities it provides its users. Next, we discussed MURS radios and that they are most commonly used by businesses.

We've learned that CB bands have been some of the most popular radio bands for long-distance truck drivers. We took a deep dive into ham radio and all that it offers. We discussed the allowed power wattage ranges for each band, and how repeaters can dramatically widen that range. We discussed licensing and when it's required and not required.

Hopefully you gained some knowledge along this journey and learned something new. Reach out if you would like to QSO or ragchew!
