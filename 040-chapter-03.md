### Chapter 3 - General Mobile Radio Service

## Introduction

General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is similar to Family Radio Service (FRS), but with more options. GMRS radios use the same 22 channels, but also have an additional 8 repeater channels. GMRS also allows the user to transmit at a higher power than FRS radios, which allows for longer distance communications and better audio quality. A license is required to use a GMRS radio, so that GMRS radio operators can be identified by the FCC.

GMRS radios are allowed to have removable antennas. Combine this with higher power wattage allowances, GMRS radios can transmit farther distances than their FRS radio cousins.

## Licensing

Obtaining a GMRS license is fairly straightforward. No test is required (although I've heard that navigating the antiquated FCC website to find and pay for the license is a test in and of itself!), just fill out the form and pay the fee. After submitting your payment, about 24 hours later you'll get an email from the FCC which links back to the FCC website. The website will show your new call sign and a link to an official PDF file that you can download and print.

The GMRS license is good for 10 years. Once a user has their license, any immediate family member (parents, grandparents, children, spouse, etc) can use their GMRS radio during non-emergency situations. During an emergency situation, it's ok for a non-relation to use the radio.

## Channels and Frequencies

GMRS shares the same 22 pre-programmed channels and frequencies with FRS. This allows interoperability between these radios, which means that GMRS users can communicate with FRS users. GMRS radios are also allowed to use repeaters on a different set of frequencies. As we'll discuss later, repeaters give users a much wider transmission range.
