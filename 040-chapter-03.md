### Chapter 3 - General Mobile Radio Service

## Introduction

General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is similar to Family Radio Service (FRS), but with more options. GMRS radios use the same 22 channels, but also have an additional 8 repeater channels. GMRS also allows the user to transmit at a higher power than FRS radios, which allows for longer distance communications and better audio quality. A license is required to use a GMRS radio, so that GMRS radio operators can be identified if needed by the FCC.

GMRS radios are allowed to have replaceable antennas. Combine this with higher power wattage allowances, GMRS radios can transmit farther distances than their FRS radio cousins.

GMRS radios come in two form factors. Handheld walkie-talkie style radios are cheapest and most common. Prices range from $50 to hundreds of dollars. They usually have rechargeable batteries and a belt clip. Mobile stations are larger, require a separate power source and usually have a separate wired microphone/speaker. They are generally mounted below the dashboard in a vehicle and draw power from the battery. Antennas are usually placed on the roof or trunk and offer wide range communication.

## Licensing

Obtaining a GMRS license is fairly straightforward. No test is required (although I've heard that navigating the antiquated FCC website to find and pay for the license is a test in and of itself!), just fill out the form and pay the fee. Before filling out the form, you'll need to be at least 18 years old. After submitting your payment, about 24 hours later you'll get an email from the FCC which links back to the FCC website. The website will show your new call sign and a link to an official PDF file that you can download and print.

A GMRS license is good for 10 years. Once a user has their license, any immediate family member (parents, grandparents, children, spouse, etc) can use their GMRS radio during non-emergency situations. During an emergency situation, it's ok for a non-relation to use the radio.

## Channels and Frequencies

GMRS shares the same 22 pre-programmed channels and frequencies with FRS. This allows interoperability between these radios, which means that GMRS users can communicate with FRS users. GMRS allows higher wattage transmission output on channels 1-9 and 15-22. Channels 8-14 are restricted to 0.5 watts for both FRS and GMRS.

Not all radios are capable of transmitting at the maximum wattage for each channel. The default setting for some radios is low power (0.5 watts) which can be adjusted up to the maximum the radio is capable of and the selected channel. Higher wattage radios have higher power requirements. Most handhelds cap out at 5 watts, while their mobile station counterparts can hit the 50 watt output for the channels that allow it. GMRS radios are programmed to stay at or under the maximum wattage allowed per channel as you switch between channels. For example, if you set your radio to transmit at high power but then switch to channel 8, your radio will max out at 0.5 watts on that particular channel.

_**Table 3-1**_ GMRS Channels and Frequencies

| Channel | Transmit/Receive Frequency (MHz) | Maximum Transmit Power (in watts) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 462.5625 | 5 |
| 2 | 462.5875 | 5 |
| 3 | 462.6125 | 5 |
| 4 | 462.6375 | 5 |
| 5 | 462.6625 | 5 |
| 6 | 462.6875 | 5 |
| 7 | 462.7125 | 5 |
| 8 | 467.5625 | 0.5 |
| 9 | 467.5875 | 0.5 |
| 10 | 467.6125 | 0.5 |
| 11 | 467.6375 | 0.5 |
| 12 | 467.6625 | 0.5 |
| 13 | 467.6875 | 0.5 |
| 14 | 467.7125 | 0.5 |
| 15 | 462.5500 | 50 |
| 16 | 462.5750 | 50 |
| 17 | 462.6000 | 50 |
| 18 | 462.6250 | 50 |
| 19 | 462.6500 | 50 |
| 20 | 462.6750 | 50 |
| 21 | 462.7000 | 50 |
| 22 | 462.7250 | 50 |

In addition to the pre-programmed channels, GMRS stations are also allowed to use repeaters on an additional set of frequencies. As we'll discuss later, repeaters give users a much wider transmission range.

_**Table 3-2**_ GMRS Repeater Frequencies

| Channel | Receive Frequency (MHz) | Transmit Frequency (MHz) | Maximum Transmit Power (in watts) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | 462.5500 | 467.5500 | 50 |
| 16 | 462.5750 | 467.5750 | 50 |
| 17 | 462.6000 | 467.6000 | 50 |
| 18 | 462.6250 | 467.6250 | 50 |
| 19 | 462.6500 | 467.6500 | 50 |
| 20 | 462.6750 | 467.6750 | 50 |
| 21 | 462.7000 | 467.7000 | 50 |
| 22 | 462.7250 | 467.7250 | 50 |

## Antennas

GMRS radios come in a variety of form factors. These include mobile stations (which require a separate power source and have a handheld microphone and speaker) and walkie-talkie style handhelds. FCC approved GMRS stations are allowed to have replaceable antennas. This includes both form factors, which means that the owner of a handheld radio can have a longer antenna than the one that came with the radio.

Replacement antennas can vary in size from a short stub to a longer whip antenna for handhelds and roof-mountable options for mobile units. Stubby antennas are good for short range and shortening a handheld so that it fits in a backpack. A longer whip antenna will give the operator wider transmitting and receiving ranges.

## Range

The range of your GMRS transmission depends on a number of factors. We'll list some of them here.

* Atmospheric conditions - clear vs rainy weather
* Wattage - higher is better
* Antenna size - rubber duck vs whip
* Terrain - hills vs valleys vs flat
* Obstacles - buildings and trees
* Automobile - inside vs outside

Each of these aspects can increase or decrease the range of your transmission. Radio manufacturs advertise ranges like 22+ miles. Ranges like these are most likely found on a clear day between two mountain tops on a channel that allows maximum wattage. Based on my experience, transmitting from handhelds from inside two automobiles on a road trip, we can hear each other about one to two miles away.

The use of a repeater, as we'll discuss next, can dramatically increase your range because your small antenna is utilizing the power of a larger repeater antenna.

## Repeaters

A repeater is an automated base station, usually with a large antenna, that can relay radio signals. GMRS differs from FRS in that GMRS radios can transmit on the frequencies that repeaters are listening on.

Repeaters will greatly extend the range of the radio.

## Common Uses

Many people ask 'Why not just use your cell phone?' when they talk to a radio enthusiast. One answer to that question is that two-way radios can be used where there is not cell phone service. It's also more convenient and safer to use a radio while driving or hiking because it has physical buttons so you can push a physical button to transmit without looking at the device. If you want to stay in regular contact by listening, radios can remain in receive mode (and are quiet when the squelch is set correctly) which means that you don't have to push a button to answer like you would on a phone, you just leave the radio on and keep it close so that you can hear when others transmit.

## Common Practices

If you're transmitting for periods over 15 minutes, FCC regulations require that you state your call sign. This allows the FCC and others to identify you (one reason may be so that they can step in if your station is causing interference). If you're allowing others to use your license, they will need to state your FCC assigned call sign every 15 minutes.

Stating your call sign at the end of the conversation is also common, it signals to the rest of the users that you're done using the frequency.

## Wrap-up

GMRS radios allow the flexibility of replacement antennas, higher transmission wattage and the use of repeaters to dramatically increase their range.

GMRS requires a license from the FCC. These radios share frequencies with FRS radios, which means that you can communicate with your friends and family who have FRS radios.

GMRS is a good way to get your feet wet if you've had any interest in radio communications and want to become a ham radio operator. It's a step above FRS and not as flexible as ham, but for many people provides enough flexibility that they use it exclusively.

In the next chapter, we'll discuss the MURS radio service which is similar to FRS but on a different set of frequencies.
